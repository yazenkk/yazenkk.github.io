Hello, I am a graduate student in the department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley where I study development economics.

Before starting my PhD, I completed an MS and a BS in civil engineering, and I helped with research in a few places:

- Innovations for Poverty Action, 2020-2022 ([sample project](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/niger-asp-reprod))
- Army Corps of Engineers, 2019 ([sample project](https://erdc-library.erdc.dren.mil/jspui/handle/11681/39859))
- Evidence for Policy Design Lab, 2017-2018 ([sample project](https://khwaja.scholar.harvard.edu/files/asimkhwaja/files/economic_shocks_and_skills_aquisition.pdf))
- Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Lab, 2016-2017 (helped with [Phong Le](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RAKkehIAAAAJ&hl=en)'s postdoctoral work and [Landon Marston](https://cee.vt.edu/people/faculty/lmarston.html)'s PhD dissertation)
- Illinois State Water Survey, 2016 (helped with [Zhenxing Zhang](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/persons/zhenxing-zhang)'s reports)
